    <p>You'll be writing two functions: one that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and the other, vice versa.</p>
    <h5>Celsius to Fahrenheit</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Write a function that takes the temperature in Celsius as the parameter</li>
      <li>The function should do the following calculation to get the temperature in Fahrenheit: T(F) = T(C) * 1.8 + 32</li>
      <li>Output the temperature in Fahrenheit to the console</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Fahrenheit to Celsius</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Write a function that takes the temperature in Fahrenheit as the parameter</li>
      <li>The function should do the following calculation to get the temperature in Celsius: T(C) = (T(F) - 32) / 1.8</li>
      <li>Output the temperature in Celsius to the console</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>You'll be writing a function that accepts an array of numbers and adds them up.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Create a variable with an array of numbers.</li>
      <li>Create (declare) a function named addUpAllTheseNumbers.</li>
      <li>The function should accept one argument: an array of numbers.</li>
      <li>The function should have a for loop that loops over the array of numbers parameter and adds them to a running sum.</li>
      <li>The function should return the sum.</li>
      <li>Call the function and pass in the array variable from step 1.</li>
      <li>Save the results of the step above to a variable named mySum.</li>
      <li>Console log the variable mySum.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Create an array of words in a sentence that describes you.</li>
      <li>Create an overlyExcited function that should console.log() rows of words. It should take an array containing the words of a sentence and output them in the developer console.</li>
      <li>Then add logic to overlyExcited that places an exclamation point (!) after every third word. This will require you to do some basic math in JavaScript, and use an if statement.</li>
      <li>The technical phrasing of the task ahead: If the current value of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for">counter variable</a> can be evenly divided by 3 - using the JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators#Remainder">remainder</a> operator - then add a single exclamation point (!) to the output.</li>

// The overlyExcited function should accept the array as the sole argument

    <p>Add logic in the overlyExcited function to the increase the number of exclamation points after every third word. The number of exclamation points (!) will be determined by how many times the counter variable can be divided by 3.</p>
