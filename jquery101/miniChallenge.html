      <h3>What is jQuery?</h3>
      <p>jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.</p>

  <section class="first-section">
    <p id="para-one">All of the methods in this section manipulate the DOM in some manner. A few of them simply change one of the attributes of an element (also listed in the Attributes category), while others set an element's style properties (also listed in the CSS
      category). Still others modify entire elements (or groups of elements) themselves—inserting, copying, removing, and so on. All of these methods are referred to as "setters," as they change the values of properties. A few of these methods—such as
      .attr(), .html(), and .val()—also act as "getters," retrieving information from DOM elements for later use.</p>
