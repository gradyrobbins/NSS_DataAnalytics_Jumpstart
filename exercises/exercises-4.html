  <h4>Codepen Instructions</h4>
  <p>Create a new CodePen pen.</p>

  <h4>Instructions</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Create an array of 5 of your interests.</li>
    <li>Loop through the interests and console log the phrase "One of my interests is: [your interest]." for each of the interests in your array.</li>
    <li>Pick your favorite interest. Add an if statement in your loop that checks each time if the interest is your favorite interest. For the one item that is your favorite, console log "My absolute favorite interest is: [your favorite interest]." Still
      console log the message for each of your other interests from the step above.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Output</h3>
  <code>One of my interests is: hiking.</code>
  <br>

      <p>You'll be writing two functions: one that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and the other, vice versa.</p>
      <h5>Celsius to Fahrenheit</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Write a function that takes the temperature in Celsius as the parameter</li>
        <li>The function should do the following calculation to get the temperature in Fahrenheit: T(F) = T(C) * 1.8 + 32</li>
        <li>Output the temperature in Fahrenheit to the console</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Fahrenheit to Celsius</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Write a function that takes the temperature in Fahrenheit as the parameter</li>
        <li>The function should do the following calculation to get the temperature in Celsius: T(C) = (T(F) - 32) / 1.8</li>
        <li>Output the temperature in Celsius to the console</li>

      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <p>You'll be writing a function that accepts an array of numbers and adds them up.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a variable with an array of numbers.</li>
        <li>Create (declare) a function named addUpAllTheseNumbers.</li>
        <li>The function should accept one argument: an array of numbers.</li>
        <li>The function should have a for loop that loops over the array of numbers parameter and adds them to a running sum.</li>
        <li>The function should return the sum.</li>
        <li>Call the function and pass in the array variable from step 1.</li>
        <li>Save the results of the step above to a variable named mySum.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Create an array of words in a sentence that describes you.</li>
        <li>Create an overlyExcited function that should console.log() rows of words. It should take an array containing the words of a sentence and output them in the developer console.</li>
        <li>Then add logic to overlyExcited that places an exclamation point (!) after every third word. This will require you to do some basic math in JavaScript, and use an if statement.</li>
        <li>The technical phrasing of the task ahead: If the current value of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for">counter variable</a> can be evenly divided by 3 - using the JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators#Remainder">remainder</a>          operator - then add a single exclamation point (!) to the output.</li>
