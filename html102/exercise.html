   <h1>HTML Exercise: Personal Blog Page</h1>

   <h3>Codepen Instructions</h3>
   <p>Create a new CodePen pen.</p>


   <h3>Instructions</h3>
   <p>Build a basic blog page that has 3 articles and any random topics you want to talk about. The text can be anything, even placeholder text ( look at this <a href="http://lorem-ipsum.perbang.dk/">lorem ipsum text generator</a> for an example of the official unofficial gibberish of web developers everywhere ). The blog page should contain the following:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>A page header containing the blog's title</li>
     <li>A page footer containing the copyright notice (view pretty much any web site to see an example)</li>
     <li>Each article has a header containing a title</li>
     <li>Each article has a footer containing the author and publication date</li>
     <li>Each article has at least one section</li>
   </ul>
